## Introduction
This document describes the project plan for 'The recovery and stress meter project' to be conducted during the Hardware courses at Metropolia UAS in 2023. The project will be planned during the Hardware 1 courses and the project itself will be carried out during the Hardware 2 courses in March, April and May of 2023. 
The project's main task is to create a portable heart rate monitor which works wirelessly and records data in real time. 
In order to do this, we will learn about the necessary hardware and software to create such a system.

## Project Description
### HARDWARE COMPONENTS:
- **Protoboard**\
    Passive protoboard specially designed for this project to help connect the other components to the Raspberry Pi Pico. 

- **Raspberry Pi Pico**\
    Dual-core ARM processor microcontroller having 246 kB SRAM and 2 MB on-board Flash. It also includes 2.4 GHz wireless LAN and 26 multifunction GPIO pins. 

- **Crowtail Pulse Sensor v2.0**\
    Optical heart rate sensor having LED, photodiode, analog amplifier, and analog signal output. Operating voltage 3-5 V. 

- **OLED Display**\
    SSD1306 compatible 128x64 monochrome organic LED-display. Communicates with I2C or UART-protocol. 

- **Rotary Knob**\
    Digital rotary knob with push button. 

- **Raspberry Pi 4**\
    A computer that will be used to host our Web Server and for data storing purposes. 

- **ASUS RT-AX53U**\
    A 2x2 dualband WiFI router. 

### SOFTWARE TOOLS:
- **Raspberry Pi OS**\
    Operating system for the Raspberry Pi used in our server. 

- **Apache 2**\
    HTTP server software used to implement our own Web server for this projectâ€™s purposes. 

- **MicroPython**
    Language used to program the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. 

- **Ulab**\
    A numpy-like module for MicroPython to speed up mathematical operations on arrays. 

- **Kubios Cloud**\
    A HRV (heart rate variability) analysis provider. 

- **MariaDB**\
    Database used to store our data. 

- **Thonny IDE**\
    Development environment for MicroPython. 

- **Wokwi**\
    A browser-based simulator for various boards, e.g. Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico

## Communication
To ensure that our project goes smoothly we will aim to communicate with each other on a regular basis. In order to do that we will be using a combination of Discord, GitHub and in-person meetings. A private Discord server will be used for online communication as well as keeping a record of meeting minutes. GitHub will be used for file sharing and storage. Finally we will have in-person meetings to check up on team progress and evaluate next steps. The project work will be done as a combination of work from home as well as in-person meetings.

## Version Control

We will be handling version control primarily by using GitHub. Additionally, we will be pushing each major update to our private GitLab repository which is accessible to our project coordinator. For document and material storage we will be using our Discord server as well as GitHub. 

## Schedule
The following image shows our proposed schedule.

## Goals
Our team's goal is to better understand hardware systems by developing our own functional hardware system. The system must satisfy the guidelines set by the [Requirement Specifications Document](https://github.com/murphyslemon/RecoveryAndStressMeter/blob/main/RequirementSpecifications.md). We hope to attain a better understanding of how to implement various hardware components such as a protoboard, Raspberry Pi Pico, Crowtail Pulse Sensor and an OLED display. Additionally, we are looking to improve our software skills by utilizing the knowledge obtained previously in our software courses.

We plan to maintain a healthy and cooperative atmosphere within the team. Our team has not worked together previously so we look forward to improving our interpersonal communication skills and learning from each other.
